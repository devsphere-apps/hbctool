A command-line interface for disassembling and assembling the Hermes Bytecode.

Since the React Native team created their own JavaScript engine (named Hermes) for running the React Native application, the JavaScript source code is often compiled to the Hermes bytecode. In the penetration test project, I found that some React Native applications have already been migrated to the Hermes engine. It is really hard to analyze or patch those applications. Therefore, I created hbctool for helping any pentester to test the Hermes bytecode.

> [Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev/) is an open-source JavaScript engine optimized for running React Native apps on Android. For many apps, enabling Hermes will result in improved start-up time, decreased memory usage, and smaller app size. At this time Hermes is an opt-in React Native feature, and this guide explains how to enable it.

## Installation

To install hbctool, simply use pip:

```
pip install hbctool
```

## Usage

Please run `hbctool --help` to show the usage.

```
hbctool --help   
A command-line interface for disassembling and assembling
the Hermes Bytecode.

Usage:
    hbctool disasm <HBC_FILE> <HASM_PATH>
    hbctool asm <HASM_PATH> <HBC_FILE>
    hbctool --help
    hbctool --version

Operation:
    disasm              Disassemble Hermes Bytecode
    asm                 Assemble Hermes Bytecode

Args:
    HBC_FILE            Target HBC file
    HASM_PATH           Target HASM directory path

Options:
    --version           Show hbctool version
    --help              Show hbctool help manual

Examples:
    hbctool disasm index.android.bundle test_hasm
    hbctool asm test_hasm index.android.bundle
```

> For Android, the HBC file normally locates at `assets` directory with `index.android.bundle` filename.

- Added HBC version 90 support (BigInt opcodes, `segmentID`, `bigIntCount`, `bigIntStorageSize`, `functionSourceCount`)
- Updated Python requirement to 3.8+
- Added `LoadConstBigInt` and `LoadConstBigIntLongIndex` opcodes for v90+
- Added BigInt table and storage parsing
- Added FunctionSource table parsing

### v0.1.5
- Added HBC version 85 support

### v0.1.4
- Added HBC version 84 support

### v0.1.3 and earlier
- Initial versions with HBC 59, 62, 74, 76 support

## Troubleshooting

**Unsupported HBC version error**

If you see `The HBC version (X) is not supported`, check the table above. If your version is listed and you still get this error, ensure you have the latest hbctool installed:

```
pip install --upgrade hbctool
```

**How to identify your HBC version**

The version is stored at bytes 8–11 (little-endian uint32) of the bundle file, immediately after the 8-byte magic number. You can check it with:

```python
import struct
with open("index.android.bundle", "rb") as f:
    f.seek(8)
    version = struct.unpack("<I", f.read(4))[0]
print(f"HBC version: {version}")
```

**Patched bundle fails to load**

Ensure the `fileLength` field in the header matches the actual file size after assembly. Also verify that instruction sizes have not exceeded their original bytecode size limits.

## Next Step

- Add the other Hermes bytecode versions
- Create a class abstraction
- Support overflow patching
- Do all TODO, NOTE, FIXME in source code
